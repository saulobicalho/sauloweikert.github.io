Amigas: Ao fazer esta publicação não quero roubar a voz de nenhuma de vocês. Pelo contrário, preciso escutá-las. Também não
quero aparecer às custas disso. O que acontece é que nas minhas buscas pessoais e questionamentos se tornou necessário
compartilhar esse texto, pois mexeu com muitas coisas que sinto, e me serviu bastante. É daqueles textos para ser lido por
toda uma vida.
<br/><br/>
Amigxs: Ressalto alguns trechos(tradução do Chrome):
<br/><br/>
"... é a força da masculinidade estereotipada e não sua perda que causa tanto sofrimento entre homens e meninos em nossa
sociedade".
<br/><br/>
"Se quisermos acabar com os muitos danos que afetam particularmente os homens, precisamos nos libertar da masculinidade
patriarcal, não recuar para a criação defensiva de mitos sobre os "dias de glória" do passado, quando os homens eram homens
e as mulheres eram mulheres."

    <h1>Men are hurting, but feminism isn't to blame</h1>
    <p><span>David Duriesmith</span></p>
    <p>Have men been psychologically castrated by the gender equality movement? Are they punished for their masculinity? A provocative piece titled 'They're out to shear away masculinity' in <em>The Australian </em>suggested as much recently.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Lamenting the loss of rigid gender categories, the article argued that in order to achieve a "bizarre societal equilibrium", the [gender equality] movement is "intent on resetting the natural laws/odds in the name of a utopian level playing field, where the unfair advantages of testosterone are eliminated". Men, it continued, are "expected to reject their masculinity to avoid offending those who are always offended". </p><p><br><br></p><p>Naturally, we here at BroadAgenda wanted to know what the actual research says about the issue, so we asked Dr David Duriesmith, an expert in masculinities at the University of Queensland, for his take on the topic. Read his response below. </p>
    <p>Men in our society seem to be struggling. We have higher suicide rates, are more likely to be victims of interpersonal violence, worse health outcomes, suffer from loneliness, die earlier and are more likely to rely on drugs and alcohol to cope.</p><p>When combined, these factors have led some to conclude that men are under attack and our increasingly ‘feminised’ society is to blame. This is not a new argument to those who work on masculinity, but recently Dimitri Gonis expressed it again in <em>The Australian</em>, suggesting that men’s falling testosterone levels were indicative of a society that ‘castrated’ men and punished them for their innate masculinity.</p><div class="captionImage leftAlone" style="width: 600px;">
    <p class="caption leftAlone">Is the feminised society to blame for the fact that men increasingly seem to be struggling? </p>
    </div><p>While Gonis is right to suggest that Australian men are suffering, he fails to appreciate that it is the strength of stereotypical masculinity and not its loss that causes so much suffering among men and boys in our society.</p><blockquote>
    <p>Put simply, dominant models of masculinity make us sick, sad and unwilling to seek health</p>
    </blockquote><p>There now exists a robust body of research on the kinds of harms which affect men more than women or non-binary people. Research suggests that in most instances it is precisely those ‘traditional’ notions of masculinity that Gonis lauds which harm men. </p><p>In their <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2006/184/2/what-do-we-know-about-mens-help-seeking-and-health-service-use" target="_blank">2006 review of men’s access to health care</a><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1557988318785549" target="_blank">, Smith et al. found that dominant notions of masculinity such as stoicism, independence and valuing of strength meant that men felt seeking care was feminine or failure, particularly when it concerns</a> mental health. This is compounded by men’s tendency to view risky or destructive behaviour as manly, resulting in men’s higher consumption of <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/substance-use-in-women/sex-gender-differences-in-substance-use" target="_blank">drugs, </a><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14768320600941772?casa_token=Ts4xo2kEHXEAAAAA:QCeXCEcmQzEmC5uZgR63lUi8MI11lt40EkINVXBFtGKQ8n_ZhxlU0MRikl8UMi6jDMk35FMo9PAu" target="_blank">alcohol, </a><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07409710590915409?casa_token=2uaTArpdLIwAAAAA:qhyjFoAElVwEz2IFCHoqtd6Wc_qZVNnS5DkWW67-jB80eacflDfWtmiePu2U92ekwYBQyY2gPTjG" target="_blank">meat</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-how-much-junk-food-the-average-australian-eats-every-week-2016-9" target="_blank">unhealthy food</a>. Put simply, dominant models of masculinity make us sick, sad and unwilling to seek health.</p><p>Masculinity also operates on a structural level; it shapes the institutions and regulates collective practices in ways that harm men. Masculine norms which prioritise violent resolution of conflict and military service make states more <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3693510" target="_blank">likely to go to war</a>. While Gonis laments that the degradation of masculinity has resulted in a situation where the “warrior has lost his battleground” this should be seen as a success for men.</p><blockquote>
    <p>War makes men expendable by appealing to their masculinity; it also leaves them scarred with traumas that cannot be processed due to the association with masculine strength</p>
    </blockquote><p>War <a href="https://www.kathleenbarry.net/books.htm" target="_blank">makes men expendable</a> by appealing to their masculinity; it also leaves them scarred with traumas that cannot be processed due to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-13202-001" target="_blank">the association with masculine strength.</a> These links mean that masculinity demands that men suffer and be laid low to prove their manhood then leaves them unable to deal with the reality of those experiences.</p><p>There is one point that I will concede to Gonis, which is that the changing gender norms have been traumatic for many men and resulted in a profound sense of loss among many. The structural conditions around work, marriage and politics are all shifting in ways that weaken men’s dominance.</p><p>Work in the United States has suggested that these shifts have left many young men feeling like they exist in a state of limbo. Due to increased casualisation and a breakdown of manufacturing in the Global North, young men often feel that they cannot transition into a stereotypical <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780060831356/guyland/" target="_blank">form of adult manhood</a>.</p><div class="captionImage leftAlone" style="width: 600px;">
    <p class="caption leftAlone">Young men often feel like they can't transition into a stereotypical form of adult manhood.</p>
    </div><p>In addition to this, changing norms around dating and sexuality have resulted in a violent backlash from men who are convinced that feminism has ‘gone too far’ and <a href="https://www.academia.edu/37532571/Recognizing_the_Violent_Extremist_Ideology_of_Incels" target="_blank">demonised heterosexual men</a>.  So, while the small incremental challenges to dominance are no doubt being strongly felt by some men, this is less reflective of real oppression than a result of the truism <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-boeskool/when-youre-accustomed-to-privilege_b_9460662.html" target="_blank">that when you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.</a></p><blockquote>
    <p>If we are to end the many harms which particularly affect men, we need to break free of patriarchal masculinity, not retreat into defensive myth-making about the past ‘glory days’ when the men were men and the women were women</p>
    </blockquote><p>Gonis’ argument about the emasculation of men, while not new, is unsupported by the rich body of evidence on men and masculinity which has been collated over the past thirty years. If we are to end the many harms which particularly affect men, we need to break free of patriarchal masculinity, not retreat into defensive myth-making about the past ‘glory days’ when the men were men and the women were women. This requires that we create new ways to find meaning, satisfaction and intimacy without trotting out the same old tired tropes of heterosexual manhood that got us into this mess. </p>

Gostaria de compartilhar o trecho de um pequeno documentário que vi recentemente. São cenas de um ritual de fertilidade
feito por uma sacerdotisa em Myanmar, no sudeste da Ásia. Consiste em dar três beijos na cabeça de uma cobra. Me chamam
a atenção a coragem e devoção, um gesto repleto de significado. Para defender a vida (no caso, a fertilidade), ela (a
sacerdotisa) se apresenta de corpo e alma, um completo entregar-se. É uma imagem que gostaria (e que preciso) me propor
como referência nesse novo ano, que se coloca com suas próprias incertezas, suas precariedades e seus riscos, apesar da
permanente busca da fertilidade, que é a busca da própria vida, e que nos mantém vivos.

Esse vídeo é de uma série que descobri no youtube. Achei este episódio bem interessante. Aquela velha máxima de cobrar do
outro sem ver o que o outro passa. Deu pra me dar conta de algumas coisas. Acho que muitos caras também não estão habituados
a pensar as várias situações traduzidas. Acho que tem pontos que são opiniões próprias dos personagens também. Mas no geral
fala de situações absurdas (algumas óbvias, outras mais "discretas") que ocorrem no nosso cotidiano e de respeito, diálogo,
aprendizado. Sei lá, são algumas impressões iniciais desse primeiro contato com a estória. Ultimamente venho sentindo uma
necessidade de aprimorar a minha escuta a partir de outros locais de fala e é surpreendente quantas realidades estão aí (e
há tanto tempo), nos dizendo tanto e como a gente aprende com elas. Algumas frases que me puseram para refletir:
<br/><br/>
"People don't want your fucking pity or for you to be some Protector Man, they just want you to not be a piece of shit."
<br/><br/>
"...You just need to listen, and be the kind of person where people will tell you things to begin with. I don't ever want
you to look at me differently... I don't want you to feel sorry for me, I don't want you to treat me like a victim and I
don't want you to think you're a bad person. I just want you to realize that there's a lot that people don't talk about,
so there's a lot you don't know. So your picture of what it's like to be a person is probably incomplete."
